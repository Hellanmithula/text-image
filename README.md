# 🧠 Abstract

This project demonstrates the use of the **Stable Diffusion** deep learning model to generate realistic images from textual descriptions. Using the `diffusers` library by Hugging Face, the model translates descriptive text prompts into high-quality digital artwork. 

In this example, the prompt *“a girl with a long gown and wings like a fairy”* is used to create an imaginative and visually detailed image. The **Stable Diffusion v1.5** model runs efficiently with GPU acceleration, enabling fast and creative image synthesis. This project showcases the potential of generative AI in digital art, media design, and creative visualization.
